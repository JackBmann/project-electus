Project Electus - Business Professionals of America Software Engineering Team submission 2013-2014

An upload of the final code and documentation from my team's submission for BPA Software Engineering Team in 2013-2014.

We worked on this project during the 2013-2014 school year at Clear Lake High School.
Each of the team members had a different role,  I was in charge of documentation and did some programming.
The project placed one or two spots away from making Nationals (~8th place).
